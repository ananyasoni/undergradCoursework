            Originally created by Marsha Jean Falco of Set Enterprises, Inc.,
            Set is a card game with a board of non-duplicate cards. There are two levels
            of difficulty for this game.
            In Standard
            Difficulty there are 4 different attributes (style, color, shape, and count) -
            each attribute can have one of three values. For example, shape can have 3
            values: "diamond", "oval", or "squiggle". In Easy Difficulty, all cards share a
            "solid" style attribute, so only the other 3 attributes can be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Set is a selection of 3 cards such that for each of attributes, all
            three cards have the same value or none of the cards have the same value.
            Your goal is to find as many Sets as you can on the board!
